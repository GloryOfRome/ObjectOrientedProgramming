Project
We want to create an RPG game, like the games where you are a hero and you are fighting monsters.

The game will start with asking about our name, then it will present us with the following options:

Show our statistics (like number of games we played so far, number of games we won so far…etc)

Show our inventory (like what weapons and armors we currently have)

Fight! (it will start a fighting game between us and a random monster from a list of monsters)

The game has the following classes:

Hero, which represents us (the player), the hero has the following properties:

        Name

        Base Strength (will be added to the weapon’s strength to calculate attacks damage)

        Base Defense (will be added to the armor’s defense to calculate the defense against each attack)

        OriginalHealth (Hit Points)

        CurrentHealth

        EquippedWeapon

        EquippedArmor

        ArmorsBag

        WeaponsBag

And the following functions:

Show Stats

Show Inventory

Equip Weapon

Equip Armor

Monster, which has the following properties:

        Name

        Strength

        Defense

        OriginalHealth

        CurrentHealth

Weapon and Armor classes, both have a Name and a power property

Fight class, this class is responsible for organizing the fight, so there should be a function for the hero turn, monster turn, Win and Lose functions, of course you win if the monster died, and you lose if you died first(your Health == 0)

The attack damage of the user is (User Strength + Equipped weapon strength)

The Defense property means how much HP you can block with EACH received attack

The Defense of the user is (User Defense + Equipped Armor defense) 

Game class, it will show the main menu for us, and it will have a proper function call for each option in the main menu (switch statement). Once you finish an option (like showing your stats), you should be able to go back to the main menu without restarting the application.

Inside the main function (class Program), we just want to create an object (game) from Game class, then call game.Start(). 

Notes:

You can add any suitable properties and helper functions that you think are important to the solution.

Bonus functions:

The user can choose to fight the strongest (top damage or top defense) monster

A Hero can earn coins if they win a match, they can use those coins to buy Health during the game.
